# stock-analysis

### Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

**The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve expand his research on how well did the provided tickers from the stock market performed during the years of 2017 and 2018 based on daily trades and  returns. We analyzed the Total Daily Volume as well as the rearly return in percentage in price from the beginning to the end of each year for each of the tickers presented. We used macros to create loops within loops to analyze the dataset.

### Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

** We were able to analyze the correlation between the Total Daily Volume of stock trades every stock had with their Yearly Return. In the attached images, we are able to see that around 47% of the stock tickers received a higher Yearly Return when the Total Volume of the Trade stocks were higher. There isn't sufficient evidence that a higher total daily volume trade correlates with positive yearly return. In the other hand, we are able to see that the stock tickers as a majority had a better year in 2017 regardless of the change in total daily volume of trades.

## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

** Some advantages of refactoring code is that the syntax in which the code is structured can help create similar problem solvings without changing the body of the code. In effect, individuals are able to have a more clean and efficient code without changing its external behavior for future use. The disadvantage of refactoring code is that coders might have different bugs and errors if there the body of the code is significantly changed. Thus, time management could be affected in a negative way.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
** It makes it easier for new learners understand scripting by having a clean, short and organized body of code. If refactoring was not important, new learners (like me) would have trouble in starting a new code structure.
